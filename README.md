# Obsidian Better Trash

Enhanced trash functionality for Markdown files in Obsidian with automatic cleanup and restoration.

# Features
- **Smart Trash System**: Moves deleted Markdown files to a visible folder where you can view and search them directly within Obsidian.
- **Auto Cleanup**: Automatically removes files after a configurable time period
- **Original Path Restoration**: Files are restored to their original location
- **Attachment Management**: Optionally deletes unique attachments when removing files

# Usage
- Delete any Markdown file normally
- File is moved to your configured trash folder
- View the file in Obsidian - you'll see a trash info panel
- Use "Restore" to return to original location or "Delete Permanently" to remove
- Files are automatically cleaned up after the configured time period
- If a file has attachments, and no other files link to those attachments, the attachments will also be deleted when the main text file is deleted (if the corresponding setting is enabled).
